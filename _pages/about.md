I am **Rafid Ahmed**, currently working as an R&D Engineer at **[Penta Global Limited](https://www.pentabd.com/)**. 
My work focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multimodal AI, particularly in designing intelligent systems that can reason, align, and generalize across languages and modalities.My current work is centered on LLMs and VLMs, with a focus on Medical VQA, VLM linear projection, prompt learning, and finetuning strategies.  

I am passionate about advancing machine understanding for low-resource languages and building more inclusive and interpretable AI systems.

---

I am actively looking for graduate opportunities to further contribute to research in NLP, multimodal AI, and medical AI, aiming to collaborate with forward-thinking teams and push the boundaries of intelligent, inclusive, and impactful AI systems.

### Current Research Directions

**1. Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Explainability**  
Developing a large-scale dataset (15K VQA pairs) to improve visual reasoning and interpretability in medical image understanding.  

**2. Medical Vision-Language Model (VLM) Linear Projection**  
Investigating how VLMs capture subtle diagnostic cues in medical imaging and exploring the effect of linear projection layers on alignment and performance.  

**3. Medical Prompt Learning**  
Designing effective prompting strategies to enhance few-shot and cross-modal learning in medical AI applications.  

**4. Improved LoRA Fine-Tuning for Domain-Specific Classification**  
Analyzing limitations of conventional LoRA fine-tuning in out-of-domain tasks and developing adaptive strategies involving further pretraining and linear probing to improve LLM performance in specialized domains. -->
